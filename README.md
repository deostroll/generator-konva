This is a yeoman generator for kickstarting and HTML5 webpage with [KonvaJs](http://konvajs.github.io) javascript canvas libarary.

## Prerequisites
- node/npm
- grunt
- bower
- yeoman

## Installation

`npm install generator-konva -g`

## Usage

`cd` into a folder and type `yo konva` or `yo konva my-konvajs-app-folder`...and once in your working folder type `grunt`. This should wire the default bower dependencies (wiredep), and kickoff the _connect_ and _watch_ tasks.

A local livereload web server is started in port 5000 by default. Modify files in the `src` folder for getting started.
